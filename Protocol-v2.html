<h1>Off-the-Record Messaging Protocol version 2</h1>
<h1>DRAFT 2005102701</h1>
<p>This document describes version 2 of the Off-the-Record Messaging
protocol.  The main changes over version 1 include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Resolving the identity-binding flaw identified by Di Raimondo,
Gennaro, and Krawczyk</li>
<li>Not revealing the users' public keys to passive eavesdroppers; this
could be useful if the application sending the OTR messages is also
privacy-preserving</li>
<li>Supporting fragmentation of OTR messages, to support IM networks
whose maximum message size is very small.</li>
<li>Better protocol version control, for future extensibility.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Very high level overview</h2>
<p>OTR assumes a network model which provides in-order delivery of
messages, but that some messages may not get delivered at all
(for example, if the user disconnects).  There may be
an active attacker, who is allowed to perform a Denial of
Service attack, but not to learn the contents of messages.</p>
<ol>
<li>Alice signals to Bob that she would like (using an OTR Query Message)
or is willing (using a whitespace-tagged plaintext message) to use OTR
to communicate.  Either mechanism should convey the version(s) of OTR
that Alice is willing to use.</li>
<li>Bob initiates the authenticated key exchange (AKE) with Alice.
Version 2 of OTR uses a variant of the SIGMA protocol as its AKE.</li>
<li>Alice and Bob exchange Data Messages to send information to each
other.</li>
</ol>
<h2>High level overview</h2>
<h3>Requesting an OTR conversation</h3>
<p>There are two ways Alice can inform Bob that she is willing to use
the OTR protocol to speak with him: by sending him the OTR Query Message, 
or by including a special "tag" consisting of whitespace characters in
one of her messages to him.  Each method also includes a way for Alice
to communicate to Bob which versions of the OTR protocol she is willing
to speak with him.</p>
<p>The semantics of the OTR Query Message are that Alice is
<em>requesting</em> that Bob start an OTR conversation with her (if, of
course, he is willing and able to do so).  On the other hand, the
semantics of the whitespace tag are that Alice is merely
<em>indicating</em> to Bob that she is willing and able to have an OTR
conversation with him.  If Bob has a policy of "only use OTR when it's
explicitly requested", for example, then he <em>would</em> start an OTR
conversation upon receiving an OTR Query Message, but <em>would not</em>
upon receiving the whitespace tag.</p>
<h3>Authenticated Key Exchange (AKE)</h3>
<p>This section outlines the version of the SIGMA protocol used as the
AKE.  All exponentiations are done modulo a particular 1536-bit prime,
and g is a generator of that group, as indicated in the detailed
description below.  Alice and Bob's long-term authentication public keys
are pub<sub>A</sub> and pub<sub>B</sub>, respectively.</p>
<p>The general idea is that Alice and Bob do an <em>unauthenticated</em>
Diffie-Hellman (D-H) key exchange to set up an encrypted channel, and
then do mutual authentication <em>inside</em> that channel.</p>
<p>Bob will be initiating the AKE with Alice.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bob:
<ol>
<li>Picks a random value r (128 bits)</li>

g<sup>y</sup> &lt;= modulus-2)</li>

sig<sub>B</sub>(M<sub>B</sub>)</li>
<li>Sends Alice r, AES<sub>c</sub>(X<sub>B</sub>),
MAC<sub>m2</sub>(AES<sub>c</sub>(X<sub>B</sub>))</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Alice:
<ol>
<li>Uses r to decrypt the value of g<sup>x</sup> sent earlier</li>
<li>Verifies that HASH(g<sup>x</sup>) matches the value sent earlier</li>
<li>Verifies that Bob's g<sup>x</sup> is a legal value (2 &lt;=
g<sup>x</sup> &lt;= modulus-2)</li>
<li>Computes s = (g<sup>x</sup>)<sup>y</sup> (note that this will be the
same as the value of s Bob calculated)</li>
<li>Computes two AES keys c, c' and four MAC keys m1, m1', m2, m2' by
hashing s in various ways (the same as Bob)</li>
<li>Uses m2 to verify MAC<sub>m2</sub>(AES<sub>c</sub>(X<sub>B</sub>))</li>
<li>Uses c to decrypt AES<sub>c</sub>(X<sub>B</sub>) to obtain
X<sub>B</sub> = pub<sub>B</sub>, keyid<sub>B</sub>,
sig<sub>B</sub>(M<sub>B</sub>)</li>
<li>Computes M<sub>B</sub> = MAC<sub>m1</sub>(g<sup>x</sup>,
g<sup>y</sup>, pub<sub>B</sub>, keyid<sub>B</sub>)</li>
<li>Uses pub<sub>B</sub> to verify sig<sub>B</sub>(M<sub>B</sub>)</li>

<li>Picks keyid<sub>A</sub>, a serial number for her D-H key

<li>Computes M<sub>A</sub> = MAC<sub>m1'</sub>(g<sup>y</sup>, g<sup>x</sup>,

</ol></li>
<li>If all of the verifications succeeded, Alice and Bob now know each
other's Diffie-Hellman public keys, and share the value s.  Alice is
assured that s is known by someone with access to the private key
corresponding to pub<sub>B</sub>, and similarly for Bob.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Exchanging data</h3>
<p>This section outlines the method used to protect data being exchanged
between Alice and Bob.  As above, all exponentiations are done modulo
a particular 1536-bit prime, and g is a generator of
that group, as indicated in the detailed description below.</p>
<p>Suppose Alice has a message (msg) to send to Bob.</p>
<ul>
<li>Alice:
<ol>
<li>Picks the most recent of her own D-H encryption keys that Bob has
acknowledged receiving (by using it in a Data Message, or failing that,
in the AKE).  Let keyid<sub>A</sub> be the serial number of that
key.</li>
<li>If the above key is Alice's most recent key, she generates a new D-H key 
(next_dh), to get the serial number keyid<sub>A</sub>+1.</li>
<li>Picks the most recent of Bob's D-H encryption keys that she has
received from him (either in a Data Message or in the AKE).  Let
keyid<sub>B</sub> be the serial number of that key.</li>
<li>Uses Diffie-Hellman to compute a shared secret from the two keys
labelled by keyid<sub>A</sub> and keyid<sub>B</sub>, and generates the
sending AES key, ek, and the sending MAC key, mk, as detailed
below.</li>
<li>Collects any old MAC keys that were used in previous messages, but
will never again be used (because their associated D-H keys are no
longer the most recent ones) into a list, oldmackeys.</li>
<li>Picks a value of the counter, ctr, so that the triple
(keyid<sub>A</sub>, keyid<sub>B</sub>, ctr) is never the same for more
than one Data Message Alice sends to Bob.</li>
<li>Computes T<sub>A</sub> = (keyid<sub>A</sub>, keyid<sub>B</sub>, next_dh,
ctr, AES-CTR<sub>ek,ctr</sub>(msg))</li>
<li>Sends Bob T<sub>A</sub>, MAC<sub>mk</sub>(T<sub>A</sub>),
oldmackeys</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Bob:
<ol>
<li>Uses Diffie-Hellman to compute a shared secret from the two keys
labelled by keyid<sub>A</sub> and keyid<sub>B</sub>, and generates the
receiving AES key, ek, and the receiving MAC key, mk, as detailed
below.  (These will be the same as the keys Alice generated, above.)</li>
<li>Uses mk to verify MAC<sub>mk</sub>(T<sub>A</sub>).</li>
<li>Uses ek and ctr to decrypt
AES-CTR<sub>ek,ctr</sub>(T<sub>A</sub>).</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Details of the protocol</h2>
<h3>Unencoded messages</h3>
<p>This section describes the messages in the OTR protocol that are not
base-64 encoded binary.</p>
<h4>OTR Query Messages</h4>
<p>If Alice wishes to communicate to Bob that she would like to use OTR,
she sends a message containing the string "?OTR" followed by an
indication of what versions of OTR she is willing to use with Bob.  The
version string is constructed as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>If she is willing to use OTR version 1, the version string must
start with "?".</li>
<li>If she is willing to use OTR versions other than 1, a "v" followed
by the byte identifiers for the versions in question, followed by "?".
The byte identifier for OTR version 2 is "2".  The order of the
identifiers between the "v" and the "?" does not matter, but none should
be listed more than once.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example:</p>
<dl>
<dt>"?OTR?"</dt>
<dd>Version 1 only</dd>
<dt>"?OTRv2?"</dt>
<dd>Version 2 only</dd>
<dt>"?OTR?v2?"</dt>
<dd>Versions 1 and 2</dd>
<dt>"?OTRv24x?"</dt>
<dd>Version 2, and hypothetical future versions identified by "4" and
"x"</dd>
<dt>"?OTR?v24x?"</dt>
<dd>Versions 1, 2, and hypothetical future versions identified by "4" and
"x"</dd>
<dt>"?OTR?v?"</dt>
<dd>Also version 1 only</dd>
<dt>"?OTRv?"</dt>
<dd>A bizarre claim that Alice would like to start an OTR conversation,
but is unwilling to speak any version of the protocol</dd>
</dl>
<p>These strings may be hidden from the user (for example, in
an attribute of an HTML tag), and/or may be accompanied by an
explanitory message ("Alice has requested an Off-the-Record private
conversation.").  If Bob is willing to use OTR with Alice (with a
protocol version that Alice has offered), he should start the AKE.</p>
<h4>Tagged plaintext messages</h4>
<p>If Alice wishes to communicate to Bob that she is willing to use OTR,
she can attach a special whitespace tag to any plaintext message she
sends him.  This tag may occur anywhere in the message, and may be
hidden from the user (as in the Query Messages, above).</p>
<p>The tag consists of the following 16 bytes, followed by one or more
sets of 8 bytes indicating the version of OTR Alice is willing to
use:</p>
<ul>
<li>Always send "\x20\x09\x20\x20\x09\x09\x09\x09"
"\x20\x09\x20\x09\x20\x09\x20\x20", followed by one or more of:</li>
<li>"\x20\x09\x20\x09\x20\x20\x09\x20" to indicate a willingness to use
OTR version 1 with Bob (note: this string must come before all other
whitespace version tags, if it is present, for backwards
compatibility)</li>
<li>"\x20\x20\x09\x09\x20\x20\x09\x20" to indicate a willingness to use
OTR version 2 with Bob</li>
</ul>
<p>If Bob is willing to use OTR with Alice (with a protocol version that
Alice has offered), he should start the AKE.  On the other hand, if
Alice receives a plaintext message from Bob (rather than an initiation
of the AKE), she should stop sending him the whitespace tag.</p>
<h4>OTR Error Messages</h4>
<p>Any message containing the string "?OTR Error:" is an OTR Error
Message.  The following part of the message should contain
human-readable details of the error.</p>
<h3>Encoded messages</h3>
<p>This section describes the byte-level format of the base-64 encoded
binary OTR messages.  The binary form of each of the messages is
described below.  To transmit one of these messages, construct the ASCII
string consisting of the five bytes "?OTR:", followed by the base-64
encoding of the binary form of the message, followed by the byte
".".</p>
<p>For the Diffie-Hellman group computations, the group is the one
defined in RFC 3526 with 1536-bit modulus (hex, big-endian):</p>
<blockquote><pre>
FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF C90FDAA2 2168C234 C4C6628B 80DC1CD1
29024E08 8A67CC74 020BBEA6 3B139B22 514A0879 8E3404DD

</pre></blockquote>
<p>and a generator (g) of 2.  Note that this means that whenever you see a
Diffie-Hellman exponentiation in this document, it always means that the
exponentiation is done modulo the above 1536-bit number.</p>
<h4>Data types</h4>

      bytes.  This is important when calculating public key
      fingerprints.)</dd>

<dd>      20 bytes MAC data</dd>
</dl>
<h4>Public keys, signatures, and fingerprints</h4>
<p>OTR users have long-lived public keys that they use for
authentication (but <em>not</em> encryption).  The current version of
the OTR protocol only supports DSA public keys, but there is a key type
marker for future extensibility.</p>
<dl>
<dt>OTR public authentication DSA key (PUBKEY):</dt>
<dd>Pubkey type (SHORT)
<ul class="note"><li>DSA public keys have type 0x0000</li></ul>
p (MPI)
<br />q (MPI)
<br />g (MPI)
<br />y (MPI)
<ul class="note"><li>(p,q,g,y) are the DSA public key parameters</li></ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>OTR public keys are used to generate <b>signatures</b>; different
types of keys produce signatures in different formats.  The format for a
signature made by a DSA public key is as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dt>DSA signature (SIG):</dt>
<dd>      (len is the length of the DSA public parameter q)
<br />      len byte unsigned r, big-endian
<br />      len byte unsigned s, big-endian</dd>
</dl>
<p>OTR public keys have <b>fingerprints</b>, which are hex strings that
serve as identifiers for the public key.  The fingerprint is calculated
by taking the SHA-1 hash of the byte-level representation of the public
key.  However, there is an exception for backwards compatibility: if the
pubkey type is 0x0000, those two leading 0x00 bytes are omitted from the
data to be hashed.  The encoding assures that, assuming the hash
function itself has no useful collisions, and DSA keys have length less
than 524281 bits (500 times larger than most DSA keys), no two public
keys will have the same fingerprint.</p>
<h4>D-H Commit Message</h4>
<p>This is the first message of the AKE.  Bob sends it to Alice to
commit to a choice of D-H encryption key (but the key itself is not yet
revealed).  This allows the secure session id to be much shorter than in
OTR version 1, while still preventing a man-in-the-middle attack on
it.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Protocol version (SHORT)</dt>
<dd>The version number of this protocol is 0x0002.</dd>
<dt>Message type (BYTE)</dt>
<dd>The D-H Commit Message has type 0x02.</dd>
<dt>Encrypted g<sup>x</sup> (DATA)</dt>
<dd>Produce this field as follows:
<ul>
<li>Choose a random value r (128 bits)</li>
<li>Choose a random value x (at least 320 bits)</li>
<li>Serialize g<sup>x</sup> as an MPI, gxmpi.  [gxmpi will probably be
196 bytes long, starting with "\x00\x00\x00\xc0".]</li>
<li>Encrypt gxmpi using AES128-CTR, with key r and initial counter value
0.  The result will be the same length as gxmpi.</li>
<li>Encode this encrypted value as the DATA field.</li>
</ul></dd>
<dt>Hashed g<sup>x</sup> (DATA)</dt>
<dd>This is the SHA-256 hash of gxmpi.</dd>
</dl>
<h4>D-H Key Message</h4>
<p>This is the second message of the AKE.  Alice sends it to Bob, and it
simply consists of Alice's D-H encryption key.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Protocol version (SHORT)</dt>
<dd>The version number of this protocol is 0x0002.</dd>
<dt>Message type (BYTE)</dt>
<dd>The D-H Key Message has type 0x0a.</dd>
<dt>g<sup>y</sup> (MPI)</dt>
<dd>Choose a random value y (at least 320 bits), and calculate
g<sup>y</sup>.</dd>
</dl>
<h4>Reveal Signature Message</h4>
<p>This is the third message of the AKE.  Bob sends it to Alice,
revealing his D-H encryption key (and thus opening an encrypted
channel), and also authenticating himself (and the parameters of the
channel, preventing a man-in-the-middle attack on the channel itself) to
Alice.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Protocol version (SHORT)</dt>
<dd>The version number of this protocol is 0x0002.</dd>
<dt>Message type (BYTE)</dt>
<dd>The Reveal Signature Message has type 0x11.</dd>
<dt>Revealed key (DATA)</dt>
<dd>This is the value r picked earlier.</dd>
<dt>Encrypted signature (DATA)</dt>
<dd>This field is calculated as follows:
<ul>
<li>Compute the Diffie-Hellman shared secret s.</li>
<li>Use s to compute an AES key c and two MAC keys m1 and m2, as specified below.</li>
<li>Select keyid<sub>B</sub>, a serial number for the D-H key computed
earlier.  It is an INT, and must be greater than 0.</li>
<li>Compute the 32-byte value M<sub>B</sub> to be the SHA256-HMAC of the
following data, using the key m1:<dl>
<dt>g<sup>x</sup> (MPI)</dt>
<dt>g<sup>y</sup> (MPI)</dt>
<dt>pub<sub>B</sub> (PUBKEY)</dt>
<dt>keyid<sub>B</sub> (INT)</dt>
</dl></li>
<li>Let X<sub>B</sub> be the following structure:<dl>
<dt>pub<sub>B</sub> (PUBKEY)</dt>
<dt>keyid<sub>B</sub> (INT)</dt>
<dt>sig<sub>B</sub>(M<sub>B</sub>) (SIG)</dt>
<dd>This is the signature, using the private part of the key
pub<sub>B</sub>, of the 32-byte M<sub>B</sub> (which does not need to be
hashed again to produce the signature).</dd>
</dl></li>
<li>Encrypt X<sub>B</sub> using AES128-CTR with key c and initial
counter value 0.</li>
<li>Encode this encrypted value as the DATA field.</li>
</ul></dd>
<dt>MAC'd signature (MAC)</dt>
<dd>This is the SHA256-HMAC-160 (that is, the first 160 bits of the
SHA256-HMAC) of the encrypted signature field (including the four-byte
length), using the key m2.</dd>
</dl>
<h4>Signature Message</h4>
<p>This is the final message of the AKE.  Alice sends it to Bob,
authenticating herself and the channel parameters to him.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Protocol version (SHORT)</dt>
<dd>The version number of this protocol is 0x0002.</dd>
<dt>Message type (BYTE)</dt>
<dd>The Signature Message has type 0x12.</dd>
<dt>Encrypted signature (DATA)</dt>
<dd>This field is calculated as follows:
<ul>
<li>Compute the Diffie-Hellman shared secret s.</li>
<li>Use s to compute an AES key c' and two MAC keys m1' and m2', as specified below.</li>
<li>Select keyid<sub>A</sub>, a serial number for the D-H key computed
earlier.  It is an INT, and must be greater than 0.</li>
<li>Compute the 32-byte value M<sub>A</sub> to be the SHA256-HMAC of the
following data, using the key m1':<dl>
<dt>g<sup>y</sup> (MPI)</dt>
<dt>g<sup>x</sup> (MPI)</dt>
<dt>pub<sub>A</sub> (PUBKEY)</dt>
<dt>keyid<sub>A</sub> (INT)</dt>
</dl></li>
<li>Let X<sub>A</sub> be the following structure:<dl>
<dt>pub<sub>A</sub> (PUBKEY)</dt>
<dt>keyid<sub>A</sub> (INT)</dt>
<dt>sig<sub>A</sub>(M<sub>A</sub>) (SIG)</dt>
<dd>This is the signature, using the private part of the key
pub<sub>A</sub>, of the 32-byte M<sub>A</sub> (which does not need to be
hashed again to produce the signature).</dd>
</dl></li>
<li>Encrypt X<sub>A</sub> using AES128-CTR with key c' and initial
counter value 0.</li>
<li>Encode this encrypted value as the DATA field.</li>
</ul></dd>
<dt>MAC'd signature (MAC)</dt>
<dd>This is the SHA256-HMAC-160 (that is, the first 160 bits of the
SHA256-HMAC) of the encrypted signature field (including the four-byte
length), using the key m2'.</dd>
</dl>
<h4>Data Message</h4>
<p>This message is used to transmit a private message to the
correspondent.  It is also used to reveal old MAC keys.</p>
<p>The plaintext message (either before encryption, or after decryption)
consists of a human-readable message (encoded in UTF-8, optionally with
HTML markup), optionally followed by:</p>
<ul>
<li>a single NUL (a BYTE with value 0x00), <b>and</b></li>
<li>zero or more TLV (type/length/value) records (with no padding
between them)</li>
</ul>
<p>Each TLV record is of the form:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Type (SHORT)</dt>
<dd>The type of this record.  Records with unrecognized types should be
ignored.</dd>
<dt>Length (SHORT)</dt>
<dd>The length of the following field</dd>
<dt>Value (len BYTEs)  [where len is the value of the Length field]</dt>
<dd>Any pertinent data for the record type.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Some TLV examples:</p>
<dl>
<dt>\x00\x01\x00\x00</dt>
<dd>A TLV of type 1, containing no data</dd>
<dt>\x00\x00\x00\x05\x68\x65\x6c\x6c\x6f</dt>
<dd>A TLV of type 0, containing the value "hello"</dd>
</dl>
<p>The currently defined TLV record types are:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Type 0: Padding</dt>
<dd>The value may be an arbitrary amount of data, which should be
ignored.  This type can be used to disguise the length of the plaintext
message.</dd>
<dt>Type 1: Disconnected</dt>
<dd>If the user requests to close the private connection, you may send a
message (possibly with empty human-readable part) containing a record
with this TLV type just before you discard the session keys, and
transition to MSGSTATE_PLAINTEXT (see below).  If you receive a TLV
record of this type, you should transition to MSGSTATE_FINISHED (see
below), and inform the user that his correspondent has closed his end of
the private connection, and the user should do the same.</dd>
</dl>
<p>A message with an empty human-readable part (the plaintext is of zero
length, or starts with a NUL) is a "heartbeat" packet, and should not
be displayed to the user.  (But it's still useful to effect key
rotations.)</p>
<p>Data Message format:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Protocol version (SHORT)</dt>
<dd>The version number of this protocol is 0x0002.</dd>
<dt>Message type (BYTE)</dt>
<dd>The Data Message has type 0x03.</dd>
<dt>Flags (BYTE)</dt>
<dd>The bitwise-OR of the flags for this message.  Usually you should
set this to 0x00.  The only currently defined flag is:<dl>
<dt>IGNORE_UNREADABLE (0x01)</dt>
<dd>If you receive a Data Message with this flag set, and you are unable
to decrypt the message or verify the MAC (because, for example, you
don't have the right keys), just ignore the message instead of producing
some kind of error or notification to the user.</dd>
</dl></dd>
<dt>Sender keyid (INT)</dt>
<dd>Must be strictly greater than 0, and increment by 1 with each key
change</dd>
<dt>Recipient keyid (INT)</dt>
<dd>Must therefore be strictly greater than 0, as the receiver has no
key with id 0.
<br />The sender and recipient keyids are those used to encrypt and MAC
this message.</dd>

<dd>This should monotonically increase (as a big-endian value) for
      each message sent with the same (sender keyid, recipient keyid)
      pair, and must not be all 0x00.</dd>
<dt>Encrypted message (DATA)</dt>
<dd>Using the appropriate encryption key (see below) derived from the
      sender's and recipient's DH public keys (with the keyids given in
      this message), perform AES128 counter-mode (CTR) encryption of the
      message.  The initial counter is a 16-byte value whose first 8
      bytes are the above "top half of counter init" value, and whose
      last 8 bytes are all 0x00.  Note that counter mode does not change
      the length of the message, so no message padding needs to be done.
      If you *want* to do message padding (to disguise the length of
      your message), use the above TLV of type 0.</dd>

</dl>
<h4>Key Management</h4>
<p>For each correspondent, keep track of:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Your two most recent DH public/private key pairs</dt>
<dd>our_dh[our_keyid] (most recent) and our_dh[our_keyid-1] (previous)</dd>
<dt>His two most recent DH public keys</dt>
<dd>their_y[their_keyid] (most recent) and their_y[their_keyid-1]
(previous)</dd>
</dl>

<p>When starting a private conversation with a correspondent, generate
two DH key pairs for yourself, and set our_keyid = 2.  Note that all DH
key pairs should have a private part that is at least 320 bits long.</p>

<dl class="doublespace">
<dt>When you send AKE messages:</dt>
<dd>Send the public part of our_dh[our_keyid-1], with the keyid field,
    of course, set to (our_keyid-1).</dd>

<dt>Upon completing the AKE:</dt>
<dd>If the specified keyid equals either their_keyid or their_keyid-1,
    and the DH pubkey contained in the AKE messages matches the
    one you've stored for that keyid, that's great.  Otherwise, forget
    all values of their_y[], and of their_keyid, and set their_keyid to
    the keyid value given in the AKE messages, and
    their_y[their_keyid] to the DH pubkey value given in the AKE
    messages.  their_y[their_keyid-1] should be set to NULL.</dd>

<dt>When you send a Data Message:</dt>
<dd>Set the sender keyid to (our_keyid-1), and the recipient keyid to
    (their_keyid).  Set the DH pubkey in the Data message to the public
    part of our_dh[our_keyid].  Use our_dh[our_keyid-1] and
    their_y[their_keyid] to calculate session keys, as outlined below.
    Use the "sending AES key" to encrypt the message, and the "sending
    MAC key" to calculate its MAC.</dd>

<dt>When you receive a Data Message:</dt>
<dd>Use the keyids in the message to select which of your DH key pairs
    and which of his DH pubkeys to use to verify the MAC.  If the keyids
    do not represent either the most recent key or the previous key (for
    either the sender or receiver), reject the message.  Also reject the
    message if the sender keyid is their_keyid-1, but
    their_y[their_keyid-1] is NULL.

    <p>Otherwise, calculate the session keys as outlined below.  Use the
    "receiving MAC key" to verify the MAC on the message.  If it does not
    verify, reject the message.</p>

    <p>Check that the counter in the Data message is strictly larger than the
    last counter you saw using this pair of keys.  If not, reject the
    message.</p>

    <p>If the MAC verifies, decrypt the message using the "receiving AES
    key".</p>

    <p>Finally, check if keys need rotation:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>If the "recipient keyid" in the Data message equals our_keyid, then
       he's seen the public part of our most recent DH key pair, so you
       must securely forget our_dh[our_keyid-1], increment our_keyid, and set
       our_dh[our_keyid] to a new DH key pair which you generate.</li>
    <li>If the "sender keyid" in the Data message equals their_keyid,
       increment their_keyid, and set their_y[their_keyid] to the new DH
       pubkey specified in the Data message.</li>
    </ul></dd>
</dl>

<h4>Computing AES keys, MAC keys, and the secure session id</h4>
<p>OTR uses Diffie-Hellman to calculate shared secrets in the usual way:
if Bob knows x, and tells Alice g<sup>x</sup>, and Alice knows y, and
tells Bob g<sup>y</sup>, then they each can calculate s =
g<sup>xy</sup>: Alice calculates (g<sup>x</sup>)<sup>y</sup>, and Bob
calculates (g<sup>y</sup>)<sup>x</sup>.</p>
<p>During the AKE, Alice and Bob each calculate s in this way, and then
they each compute seven values based on s:</p>
<ul>
<li>A 64-bit secure session id, ssid</li>
<li>Two 128-bit AES encryption keys, c and c'</li>
<li>Four 256-bit SHA256-HMAC keys, m1, m2, m1', and m2'</li>
</ul>
<p>This is done in the following way:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write the value of s as a minimum-length MPI, as specified above
(4-byte big-endian len, len-byte big-endian value).  Let this
(4+len)-byte value be "secbytes".</li>
<li>For a given byte b, define h2(b) to be the 256-bit output of the
SHA256 hash of the (5+len) bytes consisting of the byte b, followed by
secbytes.</li>
<li>Let ssid be the first 64 bits of h2(0x00).</li>
<li>Let c be the first 128 bits of h2(0x01), and let c' be the second
128 bits of h2(0x01).</li>
<li>Let m1 be h2(0x02).</li>
<li>Let m2 be h2(0x03).</li>
<li>Let m1' be h2(0x04).</li>
<li>Let m2' be h2(0x05).</li>
</ul>
<p>c, m1, and m2 are used to create and verify the Reveal Signature
Message; c', m1', and m2' are used to create and verify the Signature
message.</p>
<p>If the user requests to see the secure session id, it should be
displayed as two 32-bit bigendian unsigned values, in C "%08x" format.
If the user transmitted the Reveal Signature message during the AKE that
produced this ssid, then display the first 32 bits in bold, and the
second 32 bits in non-bold.  If the user transmitted the Signature
message instead, display the first 32 bits in non-bold, and the
second 32 bits in bold.  This session id can be used by the parties to
verify (say, over the telephone, assuming the parties recognize each
others' voices) that there is no man-in-the-middle by having each side
read his bold part to the other.  [Note that this only needs to be done
in the event that the users do not trust that their long-term signature
keys have not been compromised.]</p>
<p>During the exchange of Data Messages, Alice and Bob use the keyids
listed in the Data Message to select Diffie-Hellman keys to use to
compute s, and the (4+len)-byte value of secbytes, as above.</p>
<p>From this, they calculate four values:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two 128-bit AES encryption keys, the "sending AES key", and the
"receiving AES key"</li>
<li>Two 160-bit SHA1-HMAC keys, the "sending MAC key", and the
"receiving MAC key"</li>
</ul>
<p>These keys are calculated as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alice (and similarly for Bob) determines if she is the "low" end
or the "high" end of this Data Message.  If Alice's public key is
numerically greater than Bob's public key, then she
is the "high" end.  Otherwise, she is the "low" end.  Note that who is the
"low" end and who is the "high" end can change every time a new D-H
public key is exchanged in a Data Message.</li>
<li>She sets the values of "sendbyte" and "recvbyte" according to
whether she is the the "low" or the "high" end of the Data Message:
<ul>
<li>If she is the "high" end, she sets "sendbyte" to 0x01 and "recvbyte"
to 0x02.</li>
<li>If she is the "low" end, she sets "sendbyte" to 0x02 and "recvbyte"
to 0x01.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>For a given byte b, define h1(b) to be the 160-bit output of the
SHA-1 hash of the (5+len) bytes consisting of the byte b, followed by
secbytes.</li>
<li>The "sending AES key" is the first 16 bytes of h1(sendbyte).</li>
<li>The "sending MAC key" is the 20-byte SHA-1 hash of the 16-byte
sending AES key.</li>
<li>The "receiving AES key" is the first 16 bytes of h1(recvbyte).</li>
<li>The "receiving MAC key" is the 20-byte SHA-1 hash of the 16-byte
receiving AES key.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Revealing MAC keys</h4>
<p>Whenever you are about to forget either one of your old D-H key pairs, or
one of your correspondent's old D-H public keys, take all of the MAC keys
that were generated by that key (note that there are up to four: the
sending and receiving MAC keys produced by the pairings of that key with
each of two of the other side's keys; but note that you only need to
take MAC keys that were actually used to either create a MAC on a
message, or verify a MAC on a message), and put them (as a set of
concatenated 20-byte values) into the "Old MAC keys to be revealed"
section of the next Data Message you send.  This in done to allow the
forgeability of OTR transcripts: once the MAC keys are revealed, anyone
can modify an OTR message and still have it appear valid.  But since we
don't reveal the MAC keys until their corresponding pubkeys are being
discarded, there is no danger of accepting a message as valid which
uses a MAC key which has already been revealed.</p>
<h4>Fragmentation</h4>
<p>Some networks may have a maximum message size that is too small to
contain an encoded OTR message.  In that event, the sender may choose
to split the message into a number of <em>fragments</em>.  This section
describes the format of the fragments.  All OTR version 2 clients must
be able to assemble received fragments, but performing fragmentation on
outgoing messages is optional.</p>

<dl class="doublespace">
<dt>Transmitting Fragments</dt>
<dd>If you have information about the maximum size of message you are
    able to send (the different IM networks have different limits), you
    can fragment an encoded OTR message as follows:
    <ul>
    <li>Start with the OTR message as you would normally transmit it.  For
      example, a Data Message would start with "?OTR:AAED" and end
      with ".".</li>
    <li>Break it up into sufficiently small pieces.  Let the number of
      pieces be (n), and the pieces be
      piece[1],piece[2],...,piece[n].</li>
    <li>Transmit (n) messages with the following (printf-like) structure
      (as k runs from 1 to n inclusive):

      <p>"?OTR,%hu,%hu,%s," , k , n , piece[k]</p></li>

    <li>Note that k and n are unsigned short ints (2 bytes), and each has
      a maximum value of 65535.  Also, each piece[k] must be
      non-empty.</li>
    </ul></dd>

<dt>Receiving Fragments:</dt>

<dd>If you receive a message containing "?OTR," (note that you'll need
    to check for this _before_ checking for any of the other "?OTR:"
    markers):

    <ul>
    <li>Parse it as the printf statement above into k, n, and
    piece.</li>
    <li>Let (K,N) be your currently stored fragment number, and F be your
      currently stored fragment.  [If you have no currently stored
      fragment, then K = N = 0 and F = "".]</li>

    <li>If k == 0 or n == 0 or k &gt; n, discard this (illegal)
    fragment.</li>

    <li>If k == 1:
    <ul>
      <li>Forget any stored fragment you may have</li>
      <li>Store (piece) as F.</li>
      <li>Store (k,n) as (K,N).</li>
    </ul></li>

    <li>If n == N and k == K+1:
    <ul>
      <li>Append (piece) to F.</li>
      <li>Store (k,n) as (K,N).</li>
    </ul></li>

    <li>Otherwise:
    <ul>
      <li>Forget any stored fragment you may have</li>
      <li>Store "" as F.</li>
      <li>Store (0,0) as (K,N).</li>
    </ul></li>
    </ul>

    <p>After this, if N &gt; 0 and K == N, treat F as the received
    message.</p>

    <p>If you receive a non-OTR message, or an unfragmented message,
    forget any stored fragment you may have, store "" as F and store
    (0,0) as (K,N).</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>For example, here is a Data Message we would like to transmit over a
network with an unreasonably small maximum message size:</p>

<h3>The protocol state machine</h3>
<p>An OTR client maintains separate state for every correspondent.  For
example, Alice may have an active OTR conversation with Bob, while
having an unprotected conversation with Charlie.  This state consists of
two main state variables, as well as some other information (such as
encryption keys).  The two main state variables are:</p>
<h4>Message state</h4>
<p>The message state variable, msgstate, controls what happens to
outgoing messages typed by the user.  It can take one of three
values:</p>
<dl>
<dt>MSGSTATE_PLAINTEXT</dt>
<dd>This state indicates that outgoing messages are sent without
encryption.  This is the state that is used before an OTR conversation
is initiated.  This is the initial state, and the only way to
subsequently enter this state is for the user to explicitly request to
do so via some UI operation.</dd>
<dt>MSGSTATE_ENCRYPTED</dt>
<dd>This state indicates that outgoing messages are sent encrypted.
This is the state that is used during an OTR conversation.  The only way
to enter this state is for the authentication state machine (below) to
successfully complete.</dd>
<dt>MSGSTATE_FINISHED</dt>
<dd>This state indicates that outgoing messages are not delivered at
all.  This state is entered only when the other party indicates he has
terminated his side of the OTR conversation.  For example, if Alice and
Bob are having an OTR conversation, and Bob instructs his OTR client to
end its private session with Alice (for example, by logging out), Alice
will be notified of this, and <em>her</em> client will switch to
MSGSTATE_FINISHED mode.  This prevents Alice from accidentally sending a
message to Bob in plaintext.  (Consider what happens if Alice was in the
middle of typing a private message to Bob when he suddenly logs out,
just as Alice hits Enter.)</dd>
</dl>
<h4>Authentication state</h4>
<p>The authentication state variable, authstate, can take one of four
values (plus one extra for OTR version 1 compatibility):</p>
<dl>
<dt>AUTHSTATE_NONE</dt>
<dd>This state indicates that the authentication protocol is not
currently in progress.  This is the initial state.</dd>
<dt>AUTHSTATE_AWAITING_DHKEY</dt>
<dd>After Bob initiates the authentication protocol by sending Alice
the D-H Commit Message, he enters this state to await Alice's reply.</dd>
<dt>AUTHSTATE_AWAITING_REVEALSIG</dt>
<dd>After Alice receives Bob's D-H Commit Message, and replies with her
own D-H Key Message, she enters this state to await Bob's reply.</dd>
<dt>AUTHSTATE_AWAITING_SIG</dt>
<dd>After Bob receives Alice's D-H Key Message, and replies with his own
Reveal Signature Message, he enters this state to await Alice's reply.</dd>
<dt>AUTHSTATE_V1_SETUP</dt>
<dd>For OTR version 1 compatibility, if Bob sends a version 1 Key
Exchange Message to Alice, he enters this state to await Alice's
reply.</dd>
</dl>
<p>After:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alice (in AUTHSTATE_AWAITING_REVEALSIG) receives Bob's Reveal
Signature Message (and replies with her own Signature Message),</li>
<li>Alice (in AUTHSTATE_NONE) receives Bob's Version 1 Key Exchange
Message (and replies with her own Key Exchange Message),</li>
<li>Bob (in AUTHSTATE_AWAITING_SIG) receives Alice's Signature Message,
<b>or</b></li>
<li>Bob (in AUTHSTATE_V1_SETUP) receives Alice's Version 1 Key Exchange
Message,</li>
</ul>
<p>then,
assuming the signature verifications succeed, the msgstate
variable is transitioned to MSGSTATE_ENCRYPTED.  Regardless of whether
the signature verifications succeed, the authstate variable is
transitioned to AUTHSTATE_NONE.</p>
<h4>Policies</h4>
<p>OTR clients can set different <b>policies</b> for different
correspondents.  For example, Alice could set up her client so that it
speaks only OTR version 2, except with Charlie, who she knows has only
an old client; so that it will opportunistically start an OTR conversation
whenever it detects the correspondent supports it; or so that it refuses
to send non-encrypted messages to Bob, ever.</p>
<p>The policies that can be set (on a global or per-correspondent basis)
are any combination of the following boolean flags:</p>
<dl>
<dt>ALLOW_V1</dt>
<dd>Allow version 1 of the OTR protocol to be used.</dd>
<dt>ALLOW_V2</dt>
<dd>Allow version 2 of the OTR protocol to be used.</dd>
<dt>REQUIRE_ENCRYPTION</dt>
<dd>Refuse to send unencrypted messages.</dd>
<dt>SEND_WHITESPACE_TAG</dt>
<dd>Advertise your support of OTR using the whitespace tag.</dd>
<dt>WHITESPACE_START_AKE</dt>
<dd>Start the OTR AKE when you receive a whitespace tag.</dd>
<dt>ERROR_START_AKE</dt>
<dd>Start the OTR AKE when you receive an OTR Error Message.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The four old version 1 policies correspond to the following
combinations of flags (adding an allowance for version 2 of the
protocol):</p>
<dl>
<dt>NEVER</dt>
<dd>No flags set</dd>
<dt>MANUAL</dt>
<dd>ALLOW_V1 | ALLOW_V2</dd>
<dt>OPPORTUNISTIC</dt>
<dd>ALLOW_V1 | ALLOW_V2 | SEND_WHITESPACE_TAG | WHITESPACE_START_AKE |
ERROR_START_AKE</dd>
<dt>ALWAYS</dt>
<dd>ALLOW_V1 | ALLOW_V2 | REQUIRE_ENCRYPTION | WHITESPACE_START_AKE |
ERROR_START_AKE</dd>
</dl>
<p>Note that it is possible for UIs simply to offer the old
"combinations" of options, and not ask about each one separately.</p>
<h4>State transitions</h4>
<p>There are thirteen actions an OTR client must handle:</p>
<ul>
<li>Received messages:
<ul>
<li>Plaintext without the whitespace tag</li>
<li>Plaintext with the whitespace tag</li>
<li>Query Message</li>
<li>Error Message</li>
<li>D-H Commit Message</li>
<li>D-H Key Message</li>
<li>Reveal Signature Message</li>
<li>Signature Message</li>
<li>Version 1 Key Exchange Message</li>
<li>Data Message</li>
</ul></li>
<li>User actions:
<ul>
<li>User requests to start an OTR conversation</li>
<li>User requests to end an OTR conversation</li>
<li>User types a message to be sent</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>The following sections will outline what actions to take in each
case.  They all assume that at least one of ALLOW_V1 or ALLOW_V2 is set;
if not, then OTR is completely disabled, and no special handling of
messages should be done at all.</p>
<h4>Receiving plaintext without the whitespace tag</h4>
<dl>
<dt>If msgstate is MSGSTATE_PLAINTEXT:</dt>
<dd>Simply display the message to the user.  If REQUIRE_ENCRYPTION is
set, warn him that the message was received unencrypted.</dd>
<dt>If msgstate is MSGSTATE_ENCRYPTED or MSGSTATE_FINISHED:</dt>
<dd>Display the message to the user, but warn him that the message was
received unencrypted.</dd>
</dl>
<h4>Receiving plaintext with the whitespace tag</h4>
<dl>
<dt>If msgstate is MSGSTATE_PLAINTEXT:</dt>
<dd>Remove the whitespace tag and display the message to the user.  If
REQUIRE_ENCRYPTION is set, warn him that the message was received
unencrypted.</dd>
<dt>If msgstate is MSGSTATE_ENCRYPTED or MSGSTATE_FINISHED:</dt>
<dd>Remove the whitespace tag and display the message to the user, but
warn him that the message was received unencrypted.</dd>
</dl>
<p>In any event, if WHITESPACE_START_AKE is set:</p>
<dl>
<dt>If the tag offers OTR version 2 and ALLOW_V2 is set:</dt>
<dd>Send a D-H Commit Message, and transition authstate to
AUTHSTATE_AWAITING_DHKEY.</dd>
<dt>Otherwise, if the tag offers OTR version 1 and ALLOW_V1 is set:</dt>
<dd>Send a Version 1 Key Exchange Message, and transition authstate to
AUTHSTATE_V1_SETUP.</dd>
</dl>
<h4>Receiving a Query Message</h4>
<dl>
<dt>If the Query Message offers OTR version 2 and ALLOW_V2 is set:</dt>
<dd>Send a D-H Commit Message, and transition authstate to
AUTHSTATE_AWAITING_DHKEY.</dd>
<dt>Otherwise, if the message offers OTR version 1 and ALLOW_V1 is set:</dt>
<dd>Send a Version 1 Key Exchange Message, and transition authstate to
AUTHSTATE_V1_SETUP.</dd>
</dl>
<h4>Receiving an Error Message</h4>
<p>Display the message to the user.  If ERROR_START_AKE is set, reply
with a Query Message.</p>
<h4>User requests to start an OTR conversation</h4>
<p>Send an OTR Query Message to the correspondent.</p>
<h4>Receiving a D-H Commit Message</h4>
<p>If ALLOW_V2 is not set, ignore this message.  Otherwise:</p>
<dl>
<dt>If authstate is AUTHSTATE_NONE:</dt>
<dd>Reply with a D-H Key Message, and transition authstate to
AUTHSTATE_AWAITING_REVEALSIG.</dd>
<dt>If authstate is AUTHSTATE_AWAITING_DHKEY:</dt>
<dd>This is the trickiest transition in the whole protocol.  It
indicates that you have already sent a D-H Commit message to your
correspondent, but that he either didn't receive it, or just didn't
receive it <em>yet</em>, and has sent you one as well.  The symmetry
will be broken by comparing the hashed g<sup>x</sup> you sent in your
D-H Commit Message with the one you received, considered as 32-byte
unsigned big-endian values.
<dl>
<dt>If yours is the higher hash value:</dt>
<dd>Ignore the incoming D-H Commit message, but resend your D-H
Commit message.</dd>
<dt>Otherwise:</dt>
<dd>Forget your old g<sup>x</sup> value that you sent (encrypted)
earlier, and pretend you're in AUTHSTATE_NONE; i.e. reply with a D-H Key
Message, and transition authstate to AUTHSTATE_AWAITING_REVEALSIG.</dd>
</dl></dd>
<dt>If authstate is AUTHSTATE_AWAITING_REVEALSIG:</dt>
<dd>Retransmit your D-H Key Message (the same
one as you sent when you entered AUTHSTATE_AWAITING_REVEALSIG).  Forget
the old D-H Commit message, and use this new one instead.  There
are a number of reasons this might happen, including:
<ul>
<li>Your correspondent simply started a new AKE.</li>
<li>Your correspondent resent his D-H Commit message, as specified
above.</li>
<li>On some networks, like AIM, if your correspondent is logged in
multiple times, each of his clients will send a D-H Commit Message in
response to a Query Message; resending the same D-H Key Message in
response to each of those messages will prevent compounded confusion,
since each of his clients will see each of the D-H Key Messages you
send.  [And the problem gets even worse if you are <em>each</em> logged
in multiple times.]</li>
